# Computer Monitoring and Optimization Application

Welcome to my **Computer Monitoring and Optimization Application**!

This application is designed to help you monitor and optimize the performance of your computer. It provides various tools to track system resources, such as CPU, GPU, memory usage, and more. With this tool, you can keep an eye on your system's health and make informed decisions about optimization.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track CPU, GPU, memory, and disk usage in real time.
- **Performance Optimization**: Helps you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your systemâ€™s efficiency.
- **Customizable**: Personalize the application to suit your hardware and needs.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

3. Install necessary dependencies:
   - Ensure you have the required .NET runtime or libraries.
   - If using third-party libraries or APIs, install them using NuGet or follow the setup instructions for them.

4. Build and run the project.

## Personalization

To ensure all features work properly, the application needs to be personalized for your system. Here's how:

- **Hardware Configuration**: The application works best when you configure it with the correct hardware specs. Please make sure that all device IDs, GPU models, and other hardware-specific settings are set up in the configuration files.

- **Settings**: You may need to adjust certain settings, such as maximum CPU speed or GPU preferences, based on your system's specifications for optimal performance.

## Usage

1. Open the application and navigate to the monitoring dashboard.
2. View real-time data about your CPU, GPU, memory usage, and more.
3. Use the optimization tools to help boost your system's performance.
4. Personalize the application based on your hardware configuration to enable all features.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Data**: If some information is not displaying correctly, make sure that you have provided the correct hardware configuration and have the necessary drivers installed.
- **Optimization Issues**: Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions to access system resources and perform optimizations.
